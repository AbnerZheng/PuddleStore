Hello,

This is our tapestry implementation. All the functions that were required were implemented and all of
them were tested. We also believe that we handled all the errors as best as we could. 

Each file and its test is located in the file with the same name + "_test." We have tests for 
id.go, routingtable.go and tapestry.go. All of these tests are extensive enough in the sense
that they check for several scenarios within each test. More information is located in the files
themselves.

We believe everything is straightforward and there is no particular design that needs to be discussed.
However, we would like to point out something regarding the tests. The ones in tapestry_test.go require
that the ID length is 4 as opposed to 40. The way it was handed in, it was with DIGITS = 4 and the 
tests in id_test commented out. To run id_test, set DIGITS = 40 and comment out the tests in tapestry_test.go. 

Finally, we left some printlines in the testing to help you see what's happening and there were no bugs 
in this project.
 
Cheers,
